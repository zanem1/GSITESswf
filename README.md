# Basically An SWF Library
!!I use this for Ruffle embeds!!
I made this repo and git page just for flash games on my website that can be found at play.rollmeover.com !
Here is the embed code for flash games, be sure to replace "SWF URL HERE" with an SWF url made by going to the git page in the description in this repo. Add the swf file name to the end of the URL. Also if there is not a SWF on there, just request an upload on sites.google.com/gladwinschools.net/unblockmania > Game Suggestion > Enter an SWF suggestion **make sure it is followed by .git so I know that it is for my github page**
